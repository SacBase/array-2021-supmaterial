We use input files from: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
The following files should be present in this directory:

  * train-images-idx3-ubyte
  * train-labels-idx1-ubyte
  * t10k-images-idx3-ubyte
  * t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte

In the case of the Python code, we make use the of the `python-mnist`
package to get these datasets. See https://github.com/sorki/python-mnist
